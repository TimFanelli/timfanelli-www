<p>After almost 2 years of ignoring my bike on the trainer in my living room, I finally put new tires on it and took her out on the road. Here's my 13.91 mile route from my house in Norwood, down Route 56 to Potsdam, and then back home on the River Rd. Average speed of 12.8 MPH, average cadence 63.</p>
