<p>Homework one is due at the start of class (2:00PM EDT) on Friday August 31, 2012.</p>

<p>This assignment will guide you through implementing a Number Generator application that is capable of generating either Fibonacci numbers, or Prime numbers. You will learn to encapsulate "things that change" (ie, behavior) into objects, and compose those objects together to realize that "has-a" relationships can be as powerful, and sometimes much more appropriate, than "is-a" relationships, while still using solid Object Oriented programming and inheritance techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Important:Â </strong>You will need to know that in Java, you may only have one public type defined per source file, and that the file name must match the name of the type contained inside it. For example, if I have a public class named "Foo", it must be defined in a file called Foo.java. Additionally, no other public classes could be defined in that file. Use the IDE to generate your source files, and you will have little trouble with this until we get the hang of Java a bit more.</p>
