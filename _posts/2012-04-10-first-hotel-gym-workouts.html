<p>Since I'm traveling this week, I began hitting the gyms in my hotels. Got 7.5 miles in on the exercise bike and also started doing some beginner weight training to build strength... Need to do a longer ride on Thursday -- 12.5 miles -- at the next hotel to hit my 20 miles for the week, which shouldn't be too bad, only about 45 mins. for weight training, I'm following Men's Health Iron Manual beginner's routine - which is an 8 week program.</p>
<p>Interestingly, riding on the exercise bike in no way compares to road cycling at all -- very different experience, even from riding on my trainer at home. Best I could do to keep it about the same was to match my average cadence and speed. Once I get used to it and am spinning longer, I'll begin to modify it from there, changing resistance while maintaining speed, or maintaining cadence to build endurance and strength.</p>
