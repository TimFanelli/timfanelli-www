<p>Extended my route from earlier this week by heading further north on the River Rd and cutting across Rt 42, which brings you out just south of the Norwood/Norfolk school. Added about 4 miles to the route.</p>
<p>Increased my average speed, but cadence remained about the same - which means that when I was peddling, I was peddling harder, and overall coasting less than my ride earlier this week. Definitely noticed a huge improvement in my lungs after just the first ride -- had no problem with my breathing today -- and the strength in my legs is coming back very quickly.</p>
<p>Here's the route:<br />
