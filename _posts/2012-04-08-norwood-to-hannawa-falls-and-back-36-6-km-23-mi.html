<p>Extended the route to about 23 miles today (22.7) down to Hannawa Falls on Rt 56, then home on the Back Hannawa and River Rds. Increased my average speed and cadence too -- which means my leg strength and breathing is getting better with every outing. I'm going to be traveling this week, but will begin making up the extra 400 miles towards my 1,000 mi goal in the hotel gym.</p>
<p>Here's the route -- which puts my current total at 86.6 km!</p>
