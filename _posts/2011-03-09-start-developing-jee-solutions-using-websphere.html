<p>Much of this blog is geared towards a very wide range of readers: from IT Architects with multi-node WebSphere zSeries deployments with hundreds of federated WAS servers, through small business with a single WAS cluster, and even students just learning JEE and don’t know where to get started.</p>
<p>An important question for users of any scale, though, is how do you bring on new developers to build and test solutions without the added licensing cost of another WAS and DB2 Server?</p>
<p>Not to worry - IBM has you in mind.</p>
<p>You can download <a title="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/index.html" href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/index.html">IBM WebSphere Application Server v7 for Developers</a> at no cost! Additionally, you can grab <a title="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express/download.html" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/db2/express/download.html">IBM DB2 Express-C</a> for free as well! Now your development environment can run the same enterprise-class software you use in production at no charge.</p>
<p>Be sure to read the licensing terms for these free editions, of course. The WAS for Developers terms, in particular, state that you can not use it to support production environments, and can only be installed on a developer’s workstation (ie, you can’t grab the free one for the purposes of setting up standalone testing environments shared across your business). You can read more about that on their FAQ, <a title="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/faq-wasdevelopers.html" href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/downloads/ws/wasdevelopers/faq-wasdevelopers.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, once you have a WAS v7 Server installed and running, you’ll want to also grab the <a title="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/featurepacks/modernbatch/" href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/was/featurepacks/modernbatch/">Feature Pack for Modern Batch</a> to enable batch processing and programming models.</p>
<p>In the next few blog posts, I’ll walk you through getting a development environment up and running with WebSphere v7 - including how to navigate through the variety of tools you’ll need to get up-to-date with the latest fixes and feature packs, as well as DB2 Express-C</p>
