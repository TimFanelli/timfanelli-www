<p>Finally got around to picking up a set of roof racks for the GTI! I wanted a set when I purchased the car, but didn't realize they weren't on it until after I signed the papers and had the keys. Oh well :). Two years later, I'm finally back on my bike and would like to take it around for some rides in the ADKs.</p>
<p>Here's some pics showing the racks installed after a run through the wash this morning before work</p>
