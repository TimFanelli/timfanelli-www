<p>Had to do this at a customer location today, because their security group had an issue defining the cell's security certificates. Personally, I've also had to do this because I brought up old cells I couldn't remember the passwords too, or took over work for colleagues who didn't leave very detailed notes at all.</p>
<p>If you need to disable security to regain access or control over your WebSphere cell, you can do this on the WSAdmin command line (where $USER_INSTALL_ROOT is the path to your deployment manager profile)</p>
<pre>$USER_INSTALL_ROOT/bin/wsadmin.sh -conntype NONE
wsadmin&gt; <strong>securityoff </strong>wsadmin&gt; <strong>$AdminConfig save</strong></pre>
<p>Once you've done that, start (or restart) your DeploymentManager, and confirm you can log into the Integrated Solutions Console without a password (you'll be prompted for a username still, enter anything or simply leave it blank).</p>
<p>Then, manually sync your nodes. To do that, for each node: shut down the node agent and any servers running on that node. Then execute (where $USER_INSTALL_ROOT is the path to your node profile)</p>
<pre>$USER_INSTALL_ROOT/bin/syncNode.sh <em>dmgr_host dmgr_soap_port</em></pre>
<p>Your cell is now running without global or application security. Any applications which rely on application security may not function properly until you reenable security - but this will allow you to regain access to the cell and configure as needed.</p>
