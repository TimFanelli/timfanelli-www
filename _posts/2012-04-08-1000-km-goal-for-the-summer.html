<p>So I've set a goal for myself to bike 1,000 km this summer - which means I need to average 50km a week every week between last week and August 20. My original thought was to do 1,000 miles, but traveling for work will keep me away from my bike enough that it'd be unrealistic to reach it. Instead, I'll try to make up the difference (609 km, or 379 mi) on stationary bikes in the gym at my hotels.</p>
<p>So far I've covered 50 km, so 950 to go!</p>
