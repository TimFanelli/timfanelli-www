<p>Got a 14 mile loop in from Norwood to Potsdam and back to complete last week's 50k... No route map or stats, since I forgot to start the route in iBikeMyRide before I went out!</p>
<p>Got a friend of mine back on the road with me too, after spending some time cleaning our bicycles on Saturday afternoon... since it was his first ride out in a couple years too, we kept a slow pace, which let me ride in a very high resistance and low cadence to build strength. So even though it was a short distance, it was good ride.</p>
<p>Hoping to get out on Monday after classes for a long ride -- will push the Norwood/Hannawa Falls loop up to Norfolk on the way home in hopes of hitting 28 miles in one loop!</p>
