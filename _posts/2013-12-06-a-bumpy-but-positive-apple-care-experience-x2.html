<p>Over the past two weeks, I've had several interactions with Apple's support for two laptops. My experience for each laptop was bumpy, but overall positive with great outcomes - so I thought I'd make a quick post about it for the folks googling apple care out there.</p>
<h2><strong>Laptop 1: Mid 2012 Retina Macbook Pro (15")<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>I have the 3-year Apple Care on my rMBP... thankfully! I'm just passed the 1 year mark on it. I called in because the display had developed several "stuck" pixels, about a third of the way down the screen, and spanning the entire width. The support rep directed me to an Apple Store so a genius could take a look at it, but since my closest Apple store is in Syracuse, 130 miles away, that wasn't an option. He asked several detailed questions about the number, location, and appearance of each pixel, and then scheduled the mail-in repair.</p>
<p>The mail-in repair went quickly... a box with a prepaid label arrived at my house the next day. I packed my laptop in it and dropped it off for FedEx. It arrived in Houston the following morning, was diagnosed and repaired the same day, and arrived back to my house the following day with a brand new display and no stuck or dead pixels.</p>
<p>However, I very quickly realized there was now an issue with my trackpad. While it functioned normally, there was no longer any mechanical click to it when I depressed it. It felt very shallow, and dead.</p>
<p>I called back in, and was immediately transferred to a senior tech support rep, who scheduled my laptop for another repair, and explained that it would be routed to their "white glove" team upon arrival. Apparently, "white glove" service entails the watchful eye and careful supervision of your repair by a long-time experienced Apple service technician. I think it's probably just a bit of hype to make me feel like it's getting special treatment, but it gave me the warm and fuzzes, so it served its intended purpose. I'm also very certain this follow-up issue was just a one-off fluke event. Shit happens, it was really no big deal - the guy who helped me out on the phone (Scott) was making a much bigger deal out of it than I was :). He also gave me his direct contact information (phone and email) so I could avoid the main dial-in line and hold times if I needed anything for this service request moving forward. In fact, I called him back twice and he was very responsive.</p>
<p>Ultimately, they replaced the "top case and battery" on the second repair... so my rMBP now has a new display *and* a new battery, and a mostly new shell. Pretty awesome, despite the bump in the road.</p>
<h2><strong>Laptop 2: Mid 2010 Macbook Pro (15")<br />
</strong></h2>
<p>I pulled out my old Macbook Pro to see if I could use it as an interim replacement while my rMBP was back at Apple for the second week running... I had replaced it earlier in the year because it was rebooting spontaneously, and ever-more frequently. Since I did not have the 3-year warranty on it, I just threw it in the closet and got a new one.</p>
<p>When I booted it up, though, it was entirely unstable... I couldn't use it for more than 20 to 30 minutes before it'd recycle on me. I did some quick googling, and stumbled across this support article which exactly described my problems: <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4088?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US">http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4088?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US</a></p>
<p>I contacted Apple support to try to setup the repair. The representative I spoke with (Carol), let me know my purchase date was June 2011, so if this was the cause I was definitely covered; however, if I wanted to mail it in they would have to place a hold on my credit card for several hundred dollars to cover the diagnostic charge in case it was not the issue, and I would need to pay the shipping to- and from- since it's not under warranty. Since I was going to be in Syracuse anyway, though, I scheduled a genius bar appointment and brought the laptop in for diagnosis.</p>
<p>At the genius bar, we were unable to complete the diagnostic test for this specific issue; which appears to be a positive indicator that this issue is the cause. The Apple Genius, though, had a purchase date of May 2010, and told me I would have to pay for the repair!!!</p>
<p>Frustrated, I explained to her that Carol had very clearly told me my purchase date was June 2011, not May 2010, and that I would not have bothered to spend the 2 hour wait 130 miles from my house with I laptop I dug out of my closet on a whim, had I known it would not have been covered anyway. She took a sympathetic tone and went in the back, and came back to tell me the service advisor there agreed to cover the repair at no cost to me, based on the notes Carol originally entered in my case file, saying it was "positioned as a covered repair" to me.</p>
<p>They currently have the laptop, and have ordered a replacement logic board for it. I expect it to be done next week, and they'll ship the laptop back to me! (I paid for shipping, but it only cost $12.00).</p>
<p>So two bumpy but good experiences with Apple Care, for machines that were both in and out of coverage.</p>
