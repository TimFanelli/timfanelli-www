<p>I've been traveling for work a bunch, and stuck indoors due to rain - so it's been about 2.5 weeks since I last got out on my bike. Finally got in a quick Norwood-&gt;Potsdam loop though, and broke 200km towards my 1,000km goal! Have lots of distance to make up over the next week though while it's sunny out.</p>
