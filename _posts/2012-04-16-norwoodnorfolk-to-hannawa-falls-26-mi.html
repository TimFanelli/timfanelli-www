<p>Went out for a ride before the storms hit this evening -- extended the route to include both Hannawa Falls and Norwood/Norfolk for a total of 26.28 miles, or 42.3 km. It was an eventful ride -- my phone fell off its mount just outside of Potsdam, and I didn't figure it out until about 2 miles later, so I had to double back to find it and then continue back on again - adding 4 miles total to the ride, which makes this ~30 miles, or 48km (which is the total I'll add towards my 1,000 km goal)</p>
<p>Here's the route map :)</p>
