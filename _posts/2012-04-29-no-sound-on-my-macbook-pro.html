<p>Just suffered through a weird quick on my MacBook Pro running OS X Lion... thought I'd post about it in case it happens again. All of a sudden, I had no sound output. The volume controls on the keyboard and onscreen volume indicator worked, but regardless of the volume setting there was no sound.</p>
<p>On reboot, I noticed the power-on chime was disabled as well... so I reset the NVRAM/PRAM by shutting of the Mac, then turning it on while hold Command+Option+P+R until it restarted a second time. After the restart, I heard the chime - however, as soon as OS X finished booting, I had no sound again!</p>
<p>After goofing around for a little bit, I resolved the problem by deleting the audio and device preferences files from:</p>
<pre>/Library/Preferences/Audio</pre>
<p>Just delete both files from that folder, then shutdown and reset the NVRAM/PRAM again. After booting back up again, everything seems normal. We'll see how long it lasts ...</p>
