<p>It was finally time to completely redo my website again... my RFID wiki disappeared long ago, my blog had gone defunct, and the last major undertaking I'd ever done (moving it all to Apple's MobileMe for simplicity) went to hell when they stopped hosting and killed off iWeb.</p>
<p>Please bear with me as I migrate to WordPress and move some old entries here. I'll do my best to maintain any old links as I do. This site (www.timfanelli.com) will mostly contain old blog posts and anything new that relates to work or research. For up-to-date info on the wedding, the house, and the family, please see our new Fanelli Family Website at: <a title="Fanelli Family Website" href="http://family.timfanelli.com">http://family.timfanelli.com</a></p>
<p>Any links you had to this site before should still work, but will automatically redirect to the new subdomain: <a href="http://iweb.timfanelli.com">http://iweb.timfanelli.com</a> instead. As content migrates here, I'll intercept the iweb URLs and land them here instead.</p>
