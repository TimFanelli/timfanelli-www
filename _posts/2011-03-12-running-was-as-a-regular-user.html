<p>If you're like me, you like to install WebSphere in a system-wide WAS_HOME on your development system, such as the default:</p>
<pre>/opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer</pre>
<p>However, you also:</p>
<ol>
<li>Want to integrate WebSphere with your IDE</li>
<li>Don’t want to run your IDE as “root” just so you can start/stop the server, access logs, etc.</li>
<li>Find it mildly frustrating having to run everything using sudo</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s a couple quick steps that will allow you to work with your existing WebSphere installation as your regular user. What we’ll do is create a new group, wasdev, add your user to that group, and then give that group full permissions to WAS_HOME.</p>
<pre>sudo groupadd wasdev
sudo usermod -a -G username wasdev   
sudo chgrp -R /opt/IBM/WebSphere
sudo chmod -R g+u /opt/IBM/WebSphere</pre>
<p>Then just log-out and back in to refresh your group permissions, and voila! You now have full control over you WAS install with regular user permissions.</p>
<p>This is also great in production environments, where you really shouldn’t be running services as “root” anyway.</p>
<p>Note: Even though my WAS_HOME is /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer, I chose to change the group and permissions on the parent directory instead. This also covers the UpdateInstaller, which will allow me to apply fix-packs with regular user permissions later!</p>
